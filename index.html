								<h2><a>Unity in Diversity 2019</a></h2>
							</header>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/UID.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>An exhibition featuring visual displays, interactive exhibits, free food and performances. Come experience the manifold cultures of India , and what connects us all as Indians. Event organized by the Indian Student Association at UTK. The event will promote cultural and social development of students by increasing cultural awareness, encouraging students to avoid the “danger of a single story”, question popular “blanket” assumptions about a country and culture, and seek different perspectives. As an older civilization that has been active in international trade from ancient times up until today, India has had a substantial influence on global history and culture and similarly, been influenced by other regions of the world. While we believe this event would have broad appeal, it would likely be of particular interest to students pursuing Global Studies, International Relations, Economics, Political science, History, and other art and social sciences fields. It would also serve as an opportunity to network with students from different cultures and learn about their experiences and of course taste some Indian snacks. </p>
