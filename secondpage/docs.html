									<p>Thank you for your interest in the university of Tennessee. In the following paragraph, we have explained about some of the  requirements which are necessary. We have listed specific guidelines below showing the information required to complete your application.</p>
								<p><li><font size="3"><b> OFFICIAL MARKSHEETS AND DEGREE CONFIRMATION FROM ALL UNIVERSITIES ATTENDED:-</b> All individual attested marksheets from each university you have attended are required. Consolidated marksheets are not acceptable. The marksheets should be from the degree-granting university rather than the affiliated college. The marksheets and final degree confirmation should be attested by an academic official of the university issuing the marksheets (Registrar or Controller of Exams). Those verified by a notary are not considered official.</font></p> </li>

								<p><li><font size="3"><b> FOR GRADUATE APPLICANTS, ALL BUT THE FINAL SEMESTER OF WORK IS NEEDED ON OFFICIAL MARKSHEETS FOR A TENTATIVE ADMISSION DECISION:-</b> If you are enrolled in a 10-semester program, we must have a minimum of 9 semesters on official marksheets before an evaluation can be conducted. If you are enrolled in an 8-semester bachelor degree program, we must have at least 7 semesters for an evaluation. The Graduate School and academic departments do not feel an informed decision can be made when a full year of work is missing. No exception can be made. We understand the possible frustration and will make every effort to process your application as quickly as possible upon receipt of the needed marksheets and final degree confirmation. </font></p> </li>

								<p><li><font size="3"><b> FOR GRADUATE APPLICANTS WITH A TWO- OR THREE-YEAR BACHELOR DEGREE:-</b> To qualify for graduate admission, applicants from India must present a post-graduate diploma in addition to the BA, BSc, or BCom degree. The post-graduate diploma may be a Master of Arts, Science, Commerce, or Education. The Bachelor of Technology or Engineering degree qualifies applicants for consideration for graduate school admission.</font></p> </li>

								<p><li><font size="3"><b> OFFICIAL SCORES:-</b> On the Test of English as a Foreign Language received from Educational Testing Service. </font></p> </li>

								<p><li><font size="3"><b> APPLICATION FORM:-</b> A completed application form accompanied by an application fee of $60.00 in U.S. currency. THERE IS NO FEE WAIVER. If there is a problem with exchange of currency, you may wish to contact a friend or relative in the U.S. who will pay this fee for you. </font></p> </li>

								<p><font size="3"> <strong><b>Note:-</b></strong> All documents submitted to the Office of Graduate Admissions become the property of the University of Tennessee and cannot be returned.</font></p>
